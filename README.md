# Angular-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-frontend
I have developed a simple book application allowing users to operate CRUD functionalities.
I utilized an angular framework at the front-end and a Spring boot at the back-end.
My back-end Spring boot code is @ https://github.com/shivamapchan/Angular-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-backend.
